    <p>
        There are so many cool things about Websites that no one knows, like how what im saying here is part of a paragraph where you thought it was a head! I bet you had you dont even know what either of those things are ! LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL! sometimes you can even use lists because you need to list something. such as the reasons why Dylan loves websites so much 
    </p>

    <h1>WHY DYLAN LOVES WEBSITES</h1>
    <h5>A comprehensive list</h5>

    
    
    <ol>
        <li>Websites let you surf the web with relative ease</li>
        <li>They let you download games from your favourite places to do that like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">here</a></li> 
        <li>You can also lmao all the time with glorious memes </li>
        <img src="Images/GloriousMeme.jpeg" alt="GloriousMeme!!!">
        <li>You could also use it to connect to other poeple. I once had an extremly wise and smart and funny and great lecturer who told me that i had to create a <a href="https://twitter.com/"> Twitter</a> account to connect with people in the game industry</li>
        <li>And obviously... <a href="https://cornhub.website/">The Hub ;0</a> (this is corn hub the corn one please dont fail me)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The internet as a whole is used for such a viariety of things that i could never fit the entirety of its usefulness as in a simple ordered list. I think I've done a decent job at it however if you can think of any other uses follow <a href="http://www.staggeringbeauty.com/">this link</a> righty here
